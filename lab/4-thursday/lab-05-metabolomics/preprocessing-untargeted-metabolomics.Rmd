# Abstract

In this document we discuss mass spectrometry (MS) data handling and access
using Bioconductor's `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` package [@Gatto:2012io] and walk
through the preprocessing of an (untargeted) LC-MS toy data set using the 
`r Biocpkg("xcms")` package [@Smith:2006ic]. The preprocessing comprises
chromatographic peak detection, sample alignment and peak correspondence. 
Particular emphasis is given on defining data-set dependent values for the most
important settings of popular preprocessing methods.


# Introduction

Preprocessing of untargeted metabolomics data is the first step in the analysis
of GC/LS-MS based untargeted metabolomics experiments. The aim of the
preprocessing is the quantification of signals from ion species measured in a
sample and matching of these entities across samples within an experiment. The
resulting two-dimensional matrix with feature abundances in all samples can then
be further processed, e.g. by normalizing the data to remove sampling
differences, batch effects or injection order-dependent signal drifts. Another
crucial step in untargeted metabolomics analysis is the annotation of the
(m/z-retention time) features to the actual ions and metabolites they represent.
Note that data normalization and annotation are not covered in this document.

People familiar with the concepts of mass spectrometry or LC-MS data analysis
may jump directly to the next section.

## Prerequisites

The analysis in this document requires an R version >= 3.6.0 and recent versions
of the `MSnbase` and `xcms` packages.

```{r install-required, eval = FALSE, results = "hide"}
library(BiocManager)
BiocManager::install(c("xcms",
                       "MSnbase",
                       "msdata",
                       "magrittr",
                       "png"))
```

## Mass spectrometry

Mass spectrometry allows to measure abundances of charged molecules (ions) in a
sample. Abundances are determined as ion counts for a specific mass-to-charge
ratio m/z. The measured signal is represented as a spectrum: intensities along
m/z.

![](images/MS.png)

Many ions have the same or a very similar m/z making it difficult or impossible
to discriminate them. MS is thus frequently coupled with a second technology to
separate analytes based on other properties than their mass (or rather
m/z). Common choices are gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography
(LC). Such an e.g. LC-MS setup performs scans at discrete time points resulting
in a set of spectra for a given sample, with allows to separate compounds (ions)
on m/z and on retention time dimension.

![](images/LCMS.png)

In such GC/LC-MS based untargeted metabolomics experiments the data is analyzed
along the retention time dimension and *chromatographic* peaks (which are
supposed to represent the signal from a ion species) are identified and
quantified.

## Definitions and common naming convention

Naming conventions and terms used in this document are:

- chromatographic peak: peak containing the signal from an ion in retention time
  dimension (different from a *mass* peak that represents the signal along the
  m/z dimension within a spectrum).
- chromatographic peak detection: process in which chromatographic peaks are
  identified within each file.
- alignment: process that adjusts for retention time differences between
  measurements/files.
- correspondence: grouping of chromatographic peaks (presumably from the same
  ion) across files.
- feature: chromatographic peaks grouped across files.


# Workflow: preprocessing of untargeted metabolomics data

This workflow describes the basic data handling (I/O) of mass spectrometry data
using the `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` package, and the LC/GC-MS data preprocessing
using `r Biocpkg("xcms")`. It showcases the new functionality and user interface
functions of `xcms`, that re-use functionality from the `MSnbase` package. The
first part of the workflow is focused on data import, access and visualization
which is followed by the description of a simple data centroiding approach and
finally the `xcms`-based LC-MS data preprocessing that comprises chromatographic
peak detection, alignment and correspondence. The workflow does not cover data
normalization procedures, compound identification and differential abundance
analysis.


## Data import and representation

The example data set of this workflow consists of two files in mzML format with
signals from pooled human serum samples measured with a ultra high performance
liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system (Agilent 1290) coupled with a Q-TOF MS
(TripleTOF 5600+ AB Sciex) instrument. Chromatographic separation was based on
hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) separating metabolites
depending on their polarity. The setup thus allows to measure small polar
compounds and hence metabolites from the main metabolic pathways. The input
files contain all signals measured by the MS instrument (so called *profile
mode* data). To reduce file sizes, the data set was restricted to an m/z range
from 105 to 134 and retention times from 0 to 260 seconds.

In the code block below we first load all required libraries and define the
location of the mzML files, which are part of the `msdata` package. We also
define a `data.frame` describing the samples/experiment and pass this to the
`readMSData` function which imports the data. The option `mode = "onDisk"` tells
the function to read only general metadata into memory. The m/z and intensity
values are not imported but retrieved from the original files on demand, which
enables also analyses of very large experiments.

```{r load-data}
library(xcms)
library(magrittr)

#' Define the file names.
fls <- dir(system.file("sciex", package = "msdata"), full.names = TRUE)

#' Define a data.frame with additional information on the files.
pd <- data.frame(file = basename(fls),
                 injection_idx = c(1, 19),
                 sample = c("POOL_1", "POOL_2"),
                 group = "POOL")
data <- readMSData(fls, pdata = new("NAnnotatedDataFrame", pd),
                   mode = "onDisk") 
```

Next we set up parallel processing. This ensures that all required cores are
registered and available from the beginning of the analysis. All data access and
analysis functions of `xcms` and `MSnbase` are parallelized on a per-file basis
and will use this setup by default.

```{r serial-processing, echo = FALSE}
#' Disable parallel processing for non-interactive rendering
register(SerialParam())
```

```{r parallel-setup, eval = FALSE}
#' Set up parallel processing using 2 cores
if (.Platform$OS.type == "unix") {
    register(bpstart(MulticoreParam(2)))
} else {
    register(bpstart(SnowParam(2)))
}

```

The MS experiment data is now represented as an `OnDiskMSnExp` object. Phenotype
information can be retrieved with the `pData` function, single columns in the
phenotype table using `$`. Below we access sample descriptions.

```{r show-pData}
#' Access phenotype information
pData(data)

#' Or individual columns directly using the $ operator
data$injection_idx
```

General information on each spectrum in the experiment can be accessed with the
`fData` function, that returns a `data.frame` each row with metadata information
for one spectrum.

```{r show-fData}
#' Access spectrum header information
head(fData(data), n = 3) 
```


## Basic data access and visualization

The MS data in an `OnDiskMSnExp` object is organized by spectrum (similar to
*mzML* files), with `Spectrum` objects used as containers for the m/z and
intensity values. General spectrum information can be retrieved using the
`msLevel`, `centroided`, `rtime` or `polarity` functions that return the
respective value for all spectra from all files. Here, the `fromFile` function
can be helpful which returns for each spectrum the index of the file in which it
was measured. This is shown in the code block below.

```{r general-access}
#' Get the retention time
head(rtime(data))

#' Get the retention times splitted by file.
rts <- split(rtime(data), fromFile(data))

#' The result is a list of length 2. The number of spectra per file can
#' then be determined with
lengths(rts) 
```

The `spectra` function can be used to retrieve the list of all spectra (from all
files). This will load the full data from all raw files, which can take,
depending on the size of the files and number of spectra, relatively long time
and requires, depending on the experiment, a considerable amount of memory. In
most cases we will however work with sub-sets of the data, and retrieving that
can, in the case of indexed mzML, mzXML and CDF files, be very fast. Data
objects can be subsetted using the filter functions: `filterFile`,
`filterRtime`, `filterMz` or `filterMsLevel` that filter the data by file,
retention time range, m/z range or MS level. To illustrate this we retrieve
below all spectra measured between 180 and 181 seconds. These contain the signal
from all compounds that eluted from the LC in that time window. Note that we use
the pipe operator `%>%` from the `magrittr` package for better readability.

```{r spectra-filterRt}
#' Get all spectra measured between 180 and 181 seconds
#' Use %>% to avoid nested function calls
sps <- data %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(180, 181)) %>%
    spectra 
```

The result is a `list` of `Spectrum` objects. Below we determine the number of
spectra we have got.

```{r spectra-filterRt-length}
#' How many spectra?
length(sps) 
```

We can use the `fromFile` function to determine from which file/sample each
spectrum is.

```{r spectra-filterRt-fromFile}
#' From which file?
sapply(sps, fromFile) 
```

We have thus 3 spectra per file. Next we plot the data from the last spectrum
(i.e. the 3rd spectrum in the present retention time window from the second
file).

```{r spectrum-plot, fig.cap = "Spectrum at a retention time of about 180 seconds."}
plot(sps[[6]]) 
```

We can immediately spot several mass peaks in the spectrum, with the largest one
at a m/z of about 130 and the second largest at about 106, which matches the
expected mass to charge ratio for the [M+H]+ ion (adduct) of
[Serine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine). Serine in its natural state is
not charged and can therefore not be measured directly with a MS
instrument. Uncharged compounds, such as Serine, have thus to be first ionized
to create charged molecules (e.g. using electrospray-ionization as in the
present data set). Such ionization would create [M+H]+ ions of Serine,
i.e. molecules that consist of Serine plus a hydrogen resulting in single
charged ions (with a mass equal to sum of the masses of Serine and hydrogen).

MS data is generally organized by spectrum, but in LC-MS experiments we analyze
the data along the retention time axis and hence orthogonally to the spectral
data representation. To extract data along the retention time dimension we can
use the `chromatogram` function. This function aggregates intensities for each
scan/retention time along the m/z axis (i.e. within each spectrum) and returns
the retention time - intensity duplets in a `Chromatogram` object, one per
file. The `Chromatogram` object supports, similar to the `Spectrum` object, the
`rtime` and `intensity` functions to access the respective data. Below we use
the `chromatogram` function to extract the total ion chromatogram (TIC) for each
file and plot it. The TIC represents the sum of all measured signals per
spectrum (i.e. per discrete time point) and provides thus a general information
about compound separation by liquid chromatography.

```{r chromatogram-tic, fig.cap = "Total ion chromatogram.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5 }
#' Get chromatographic data (TIC) for an m/z slice
chr <- chromatogram(data)
chr

#' Plot the tic
plot(chr)
```

The object returned by the `chromatogram` function arranges the individual
`Chromatogram` objects in a two-dimensional array, columns being samples (files)
and rows data slices. Below we extract the (total ion) intensities from the TIC
of the first file.

```{r chromatogram-tic-intensity}
ints <- intensity(chr[1, 1])
head(ints) 
```

The object contains also all phenotype information from the original `data`
variable. This can be accessed in the same way than for `OnDiskMSnExp` objects
(or most other data objects in Bioconductor).

```{r chromatogram-pdata}
#' Access the full phenotype data
pData(chr) 
```

Depending on the parameter `aggregationFun`, the function can produce total ion
chromatograms (TIC, sum of the signal within a spectrum) with `aggregationFun =
"sum"`, or base peak chromatograms (BPC, maximum signal per spectrum) with
`aggregationFun = "max"`. The `chromatogram` function can also be used to
generate extracted ion chromatograms (EIC), which contain the signal from a
specific m/z range and retention time window, presumably representing the signal
of a single ion species. Below we extract and plot the ion chromatogram for
Serine after first filtering the data object to the retention time window and
m/z range containing signal for this compound.

```{r serine-xic, fig.cap = "Extracted ion chromatogram for the Serine [M+H]+ ion in both files."}
#' Extract and plot the XIC for Serine
data %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(175, 189)) %>%
    filterMz(mz = c(106.02, 106.07)) %>%
    chromatogram(aggregationFun = "max") %>%
    plot()
```

The area of such a chromatographic peak is supposed to be proportional to the
amount of the corresponding ion in the respective sample and identification and
quantification of such peaks is one of the goals of the GC/LC-MS data
preprocessing.


## Centroiding of profile MS data

MS instruments allow to export data in profile or centroid mode. Profile data
contains the signal for all discrete m/z values (and retention times) for which
the instrument collected data [@Smith:2014di]. MS instruments continuously
sample and record signals and a mass peak for a single ion in one spectrum will
thus consist of a multiple intensities at discrete m/z values. Centroiding is
the process to reduce these mass peaks to a single representative signal, the
centroid. This results in much smaller file sizes, without loosing too much
information. `xcms`, specifically the *centWave* chromatographic peak detection
algorithm, was designed for centroided data, thus, prior to data analysis,
profile data, such as the example data used here, should be centroided. The
`MSnbase` package provides all tools to perform this centroiding (and data
smoothing) in R: `pickPeaks` and `smooth`.

Below we inspect the profile data for the [M+H]+ ion adduct of Serine. We again
subset the data to the m/z and retention time range containing signal from
Serine and `plot` the data with the option `type = "XIC"`, that generates a
combined chromatographic and *map* visualization of the data (i.e. a plot of the
individual m/z, rt and intensity data tuples with data points colored by their
intensity in the m/z - retention time space).

```{r serine-profile-mode-data, fig.cap = "Profile data for Serine.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, fig.pos = "h!"}
#' Filter the MS data to the signal from the Serine ion and plot it using
#' type = "XIC"
data %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(175, 189)) %>%
    filterMz(mz = c(106.02, 106.07)) %>%
    plot(type = "XIC") 
```

The plot shows all data points measured by the instrument. Each *column* of data
points in the lower panel represents the signal measured at one discrete time
point, stored in one spectrum. We can see a distribution of the signal for
serine in both retention time and also in m/z dimension.

Next we smooth the data in each spectrum using a Savitzky-Golay filter, which
usually improves data quality by reducing noise. Subsequently we perform the
centroiding based on a simple peak-picking strategy that reports the maximum
signal for each mass peak in each spectrum.

```{r centroiding, fig.cap = "Centroided data for Serine.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, fig.pos = "h!"}
#' Smooth the signal, then do a simple peak picking.
data_cent <- data %>%
    smooth(method = "SavitzkyGolay", halfWindowSize = 6) %>%
    pickPeaks()

#' Plot the centroided data for Serine
data_cent %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(175, 189)) %>%
    filterMz(mz = c(106.02, 106.07)) %>%
    plot(type = "XIC") 
```

The centroiding reduced the data to a single data point for an ion in each
spectrum. For more advanced centroiding options that can also fine-tune the m/z
value of the reported centroid see the `pickPeaks` help or the centroiding
vignette in `MSnbase`.

The raw data was imported using the *onDisk*-mode that does not read the full MS
data into memory. Any data manipulation (such as the data smoothing or peak
picking above) has thus to be applied *on-the-fly* to the data each time m/z or
intensity values are retrieved. To make any data manipulation on an
`OnDiskMSnExp` object *persistent* we need to export the data to mzML files and
re-read the data again. Below we thus save the centroided data as mzML files and
import it again.

```{r export-centroided-prepare, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
#' Silently removing exported mzML files if they do already exist.
lapply(basename(fileNames(data)), function (z) {
    if (file.exists(z))
        file.remove(z)
})
```

```{r export-centroided}
#' Write the centroided data to files with the same names in the current
#' directory
fls_new <- basename(fileNames(data))
writeMSData(data_cent, file = fls_new)

#' Read the centroided data.
data_cent <- readMSData(fls_new, pdata = new("NAnnotatedDataFrame", pd),
                        mode = "onDisk") 
```


## Preprocessing of LC-MS data

Preprocessing of GC/LC-MS data in untargeted metabolomics experiments aims at
quantifying the signal from individual ion species in a data set and consists
of the 3 steps chromatographic peak detection, alignment (also called retention
time correction) and correspondence (also called peak grouping). The resulting
matrix of feature abundances can then be used as an input in downstream analyses
including data normalization, identification of features of interest and
annotation of features to metabolites.

### Chromatographic peak detection

Chromatographic peak detection aims to identify peaks along the retention time
axis that represent the signal from individual compounds' ions. This can be
performed with the `findChromPeaks` function and one of the available algorithms
that can be configures with the respective parameter object: passing a
`MatchedFilterParam` to `findChromPeaks` performs peak detection as described in
the original xcms article [@Smith:2006ic]. With `CentWaveParam` a continuous
wavelet transformation (CWT)-based peak detection is performed that can detect
close-by and partially overlapping peaks with different (retention time) widths
[@Tautenhahn:2008fx]. With `MassifquantParam` a Kalman filter-based peak
detection can be performed [@Conley:2014ha]. Additional peak detection
algorithms for direct injection data are also available, but not discussed here.

We use the *centWave* algorithm that performs peak detection in two steps: first
it identifies *regions of interest* in the m/z - retention time space and
subsequently detects peaks in these regions using a continuous wavelet transform
(see the original publication for more details). The algorithm can be configured
with several parameters (see `?CentWaveParam`), the most important ones being
`peakwidth` and `ppm`. `peakwidth` defines the minimal and maximal expected
width of the peak in retention time dimension and depends thus on the setting of
the employed LC-MS system making this parameter highly data set
dependent. Appropriate values can be estimated based on extracted ion
chromatograms of e.g. internal standards or known compounds in the data. Below
we extract the chromatographic data for Serine and perform a peak detection on
the `Chromatogram` object using the default parameters for centWave.

```{r centWave-default, fig.cap = "XIC for Serine"}
#' Get the XIC for serine 
srn_chr <- chromatogram(data_cent, rt = c(165, 200),
                        mz = c(106.03, 106.06),
                        aggregationFun = "max")
#' Plot the data
par(mfrow = c(1, 1), mar = c(4, 4.5, 1, 1))
plot(srn_chr)

#' Get default centWave parameters
cwp <- CentWaveParam()

#' "dry-run" peak detection on the XIC.
findChromPeaks(srn_chr, param = cwp) 
```

No peaks were identified by the call above. Looking at the default values for
the centWave parameters helps understanding why peak detection failed:

```{r centWave-default-parameters}
cwp
```

The default settings for `peakwidth` are 20 to 50 seconds, while from the plot
above it is apparent that the chromatographic peak for Serine is about 4 seconds
wide. We thus adapt the settings to accommodate peaks ranging from 2 to 10
seconds and re-run the peak detection. In general, it is advised to investigate
peak widths for several ions in the data set to determine the most appropriate
`peakwidth` setting.

```{r centWave-adapted, fig.cap = "XIC for Serine with detected chromatographic peak (colored in grey)."}
cwp <- CentWaveParam(peakwidth = c(2, 10))

srn_chr <- findChromPeaks(srn_chr, param = cwp)

#' Plot the data and higlight identified peak area
plot(srn_chr)
```

With our data set-specific `peakwidth` we were able to detect the peak for
Serine. The identified chromatographic peaks have been added to the result
object `srn_chr` and can be extracted/inspected with the `chromPeaks` function.

```{r centWave-adapted-chromPeaks}
chromPeaks(srn_chr)
```

The `matrix` returned by `chromPeaks` contains the retention time and m/z range
of the peak (`"rtmin"`, `"rtmax"`, `"mzmin"` and `"mzmax"` as well as the
integrated peak area (`"into"`), the maximal signal (`"maxo"`) and the signal to
noise ratio (`"sn"`).

Another important parameter for centWave is `ppm` which is used in the initial
identification of the regions of interest. In contrast to random noise, the
*real* signal from an ion is expected to yield stable m/z values in consecutive
scans (the scattering of the m/z values around the *real* m/z value of the ion
is supposed to be inversely related with its intensity). In centWave, all data
points that differ by less than `ppm` in consecutive spectra are combined into a
region of interest that is then subject to the CWT-based peak detection (same
as performed above on the XIC). To illustrate this, we plot the data for
Serine with the option `type = "XIC"`.

```{r Serine-mz-scattering-plot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
#' Restrict the data to signal from Serine
srn <- data_cent %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(179, 186)) %>%
    filterMz(mz = c(106.04, 106.06))

#' Plot the data
plot(srn, type = "XIC") 
```

We can observe some scattering of the data points in m/z dimension (lower panel
in the plot above), that decreases with increasing intensity of the signal. We
next calculate the differences in m/z values between consecutive scans in this
data subset.

```{r define-ppm}
#' Extract the Serine data for one file as a data.frame
srn_df <- as(filterFile(srn, 1), "data.frame")

#' The difference between m/z values from consecutive scans expressed
#' in ppm (parts per million)
diff(srn_df$mz) * 1e6 / mean(srn_df$mz) 
```

The difference in m/z values for the Serine data is thus between 0 and 27
ppm. This should ideally be evaluated for several compounds and should be set to
a value that allows to capture the full chromatographic peaks for most of the
tested compounds. We can next perform the peak detection using our settings for
the `ppm` and `peakwidth` parameters on the full data set.

```{r findPeaks-centWave}
#' Perform peak detection
cwp <- CentWaveParam(peakwidth = c(2, 10), ppm = 30)
data_cent <- findChromPeaks(data_cent, param = cwp) 
```

The result from the `findChromPeaks` call is an `XCMSnExp` object which contains
all preprocessing results and, by extending the `OnDiskMSnExp` object, inherits
all of its functionality which was described so far. The results from the
peak detection analysis can be accessed with the `chromPeaks` function, that,
with the optional `rt` and `mz` parameters, allows to extract identified
chromatographic peaks from specific areas in the data. Below we extract all
identified peaks for a certain m/z - rt area.

```{r xcmsnexp}
#' Access the peak detection results from a specific m/z - rt area
chromPeaks(data_cent, mz = c(106, 107), rt = c(150, 190)) 
```

For each identified peak the m/z and rt value of the apex is reported (columns
`"mz"` and `"rt"`) as well as their ranges (`"mzmin"`, `"mzmax"`, `"rtmin"`,
`"rtmax"`), the integrated signal of the peak (i.e. the peak area `"into"`), the
maximal signal of the peak (`"maxo"`), the signal to noise ratio (`"sn"`) and
the index of the sample in which the peak was detected (`"sample"`).

For quality assessment we could now calculate summary statistics on the
identified peaks to e.g. identify samples with much less detected peaks. Also,
we can use the `plotChromPeaks` function to provide some general information on
the location of the identified chromatographic peaks in the m/z - rt space.

```{r plotChromPeaks, fig.cap = "Location of the identified chromatographic peaks in the m/z - rt space.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plotChromPeaks(data_cent, 1)
plotChromPeaks(data_cent, 2) 
```


### Alignment

While chromatography helps to discriminate better between analytes it is also
affected by variances that can lead to shifts in retention times between
measurement runs. The alignment step aims to adjust these retention time
differences between samples within an experiment. Below we plot the base peak
chromatograms of both files of our toy data set to visualize these
differences. Note that with `peakType = "none"` we disable plotting of
identified chromatographic peaks that would be drawn by default on chromatograms
extracted from an object containing peak detection results.

```{r alignment-bpc-raw, fig.cap = "BPC of all files.", fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
#' Extract base peak chromatograms
bpc_raw <- chromatogram(data_cent, aggregationFun = "max")
plot(bpc_raw, peakType = "none")
```

While both samples were measured with the same setup on the same day the two
chromatograms are slightly shifted.

Alignment can be performed in `xcms` with the `adjustRtime` function that
supports the *peakGroups* [@Smith:2006ic] and the *obiwarp* [@Prince:2006jj]
method. The settings for the algorithms can be defined with the
`PeakGroupsParam` and the `ObiwarpParam` parameter objects, respectively.

For our example we use the peakGroups method that aligns samples based on the
retention times of *hook peaks*, which should be present in most samples and
which, because they are supposed to represent signal from the same ion species,
can be used to estimate retention time shifts between samples. Prior to the
alignment we thus have to group peaks across samples, which is accomplished by
the *peakDensity* correspondence analysis method. Details about this method and
explanations on the choices of its parameters are provided in the next
section. After having performed this initial correspondence analysis, we perform
the alignment using settings `minFraction = 1` and `span = 0.6`. `minFraction`
defines the proportion of samples in which a candidate hook peak has to be
detected/present. A value of 0.9 would e.g. require for a hook peak to be
detected in in 90% of all samples of the experiment. Our data represents
replicated measurements of the same sample pool and we can therefore require
hook peaks to be present in each file. The parameter `span` defines the degree
of smoothing of the loess function that is used to allow different regions along
the retention time axis to be adjusted by a different factor. A value of 0 will
most likely cause overfitting, while 1 would perform a constant, linear
shift. Values between 0.4 and 0.6 seem to be reasonable for most experiments.

```{r alignment-correspondence}
#' Define the settings for the initial peak grouping - details for
#' choices in the next section.
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group, bw = 1.8,
                        minFraction = 1, binSize = 0.02)
data_cent <- groupChromPeaks(data_cent, pdp)

#' Define settings for the alignment
pgp <- PeakGroupsParam(minFraction = 1, span = 0.6)
data_cent <- adjustRtime(data_cent, param = pgp) 
```

Adjusted retention times are stored, along with the raw retention times, within
the result object. Any function accessing retention times (such as `rtime`) will
by default return adjusted retention times from an `XCMSnExp` object, if
present. Note that also the retention times of the identified chromatographic
peaks were adjusted by the `adjustRtime` call. After alignment it is suggested
to evaluate alignment results e.g. by inspecting differences between raw and
adjusted retention times.

```{r alignment-result, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = "Alignment results. Shown is the difference between raw and adjusted retention times and the hook peaks that were used for the alignment (shown as points)."}
#' Plot the difference between raw and adjusted retention times
plotAdjustedRtime(data_cent) 
```

The difference between raw and adjusted retention time should be reasonable. In
our example it is mostly below one second, which is OK since the samples were
measured within a short time period and differences are thus expected to be
small. Also, hook peaks should ideally be present along the full retention time
range. Next we plot the base peak chromatograms before and after alignment.

```{r bpc-raw-adjusted, fig.cap = "BPC before (top) and after (bottom) alignment.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
#' Plot the raw base peak chromatogram
plot(bpc_raw, peakType = "none")
#' Plot the BPC after alignment
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, aggregationFun = "max"), peakType = "none") 
```

The base peak chromatograms are nicely aligned after retention time
adjustment. The impact of the alignment should also be evaluated on known
compounds or internal standards. We thus plot below the XIC for Serine before
and after alignment.

```{r serine-xic-adjusted, fig.cap = "XIC for Serine before (left) and after (right) alignment", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
#' Use adjustedRtime parameter to access raw/adjusted retention times
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(4, 4.5, 1, 0.5))
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06),
                  rt = c(179, 186), adjustedRtime = FALSE))
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06),
                  rt = c(179, 186))) 
```

The Serine peaks are also nicely aligned after adjustment. Note that if we were
not happy with the alignment results we could simply retry with different
settings after removing old results with the `dropAdjustedRtime` function. This
function restores also the original retention times of the identified
chromatographic peaks.


### Correspondence

The final step of the LC-MS preprocessing with `xcms` is the correspondence
analysis, in which chromatographic peaks from the same ion are grouped across
samples to form a *feature*. `xcms` implements two methods for this purpose:
*peak density* [@Smith:2006ic] and *nearest* [@Katajamaa:2006jh] that can be
configured by passing either a `PeakDensityParam` or a `NearestPeaksParam`
object to the `groupChromPeaks` function. For our example we use the *peak
density* method that iterates through m/z slices in the data and groups
chromatographic peaks to features in each slice (within the same or across
samples) depending on their retention time and the distribution of
chromatographic peaks along the retention time axis. Peaks representing signal
from the same ion are expected to have a similar retention time and, if found in
many samples, this should also be reflected by a higher peak density at the
respective retention time. To illustrate this we extract below an m/z slice
containing the Serine peak and use the `plotChromPeakDensity` function to
visualize the distribution of peaks along the retention time axis and to
*simulate* a correspondence analysis based on the provided settings.

```{r correspondence-example, fig.cap = "BPC for a m/z slice and defined features within this slice based on default settings.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
#' Extract an ion chromatogram containing the signal from serine
chr <- chromatogram(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06),
                    aggregationFun = "max")

#' Get default parameters for the grouping
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group)

#' Dry-run correspondence and show the results.
plotChromPeakDensity(chr, param = pdp)
 
```

The upper panel in the plot above shows the chromatographic data with the
identified peaks. The lower panel shows the retention time of identified peaks
(x-axis) per sample (y-axis) with the black solid line representing their
distribution along the x-axis. Peak groups (features) are indicated with grey
rectangles. The peak density correspondence method groups all chromatographic
peaks under the same *density peak* into a feature. With the default settings we
were able to group the Serine peak of each sample into a feature. The
parameters for the peak density correspondence analysis are:

- `binSize`: m/z width of the bin/slice of data in which peaks are grouped.
- `bw` defines the smoothness of the density function.
- `maxFeatures`: maximum number of features to be defined in one bin.
- `minFraction`: minimum proportion of samples (of one group!) for which a peak
  has to be present.
- `minSamples`: minimum number of samples a peak has to be present.

The parameters `minFraction` and `minSamples` depend on the experimental layout
and should be set accordingly. `binSize` should be set to a small enough value
to avoid peaks from different ions, but with similar m/z and retention time,
being grouped together. The most important parameter however is `bw` and, while
its default value of 30 was able to correctly group the Serine peaks, it should
always be evaluated on other, more complicated, signals too. Below we evaluate
the performance of the default parameters on an m/z slice that contains signal
from multiple ions with the same m/z, including isomers Betaine and Valine
([M+H]+ m/z 118.08625).


```{r correspondence-bw, fig.cap = "Correspondence analysis with default settings on a m/z slice containing signal from multiple ions.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
#' Plot the chromatogram for an m/z slice containing Betaine and Valine
mzr <- 118.08625 + c(-0.01, 0.01)
chr <- chromatogram(data_cent, mz = mzr, aggregationFun = "max")

#' Correspondence in that slice using default settings
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group)
plotChromPeakDensity(chr, param = pdp)

```

With default settings all chromatographic peaks present in the m/z slice were
grouped into the same feature. Signal from different ions would thus be treated
as a single entity. Below we repeat the analysis with a strongly reduced value
for `bw`.

```{r correspondence-bw-fix, fig.cap = "Correspondence analysis with reduced bw setting on a m/z slice containing signal from multiple ions.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
#' Reducing the bandwidth
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group, bw = 1.8)
plotChromPeakDensity(chr, param = pdp)

```

With a `bw` of `1.8` we successfully grouped the peaks into different
features. We can now use these settings for the correspondence analysis on the
full data set.

```{r correspondence-analysis}
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group, bw = 1.8,
                        minFraction = 0.4, binSize = 0.02)

#' Perform the correspondence analysis
data_cent <- groupChromPeaks(data_cent, param = pdp) 
```

Next we evaluate the results from the correspondence analysis on a different m/z
slice containing isomers Leucine and Isoleucine ([M+H]+ m/z 132.10191). Setting
`simulate = FALSE` in `plotChromPeakDensity` will show the actual results from
the correspondence analysis.

```{r correspondence-evaluate, fig.cap = "Result of correspondence on a slice containing the isomers Leucine and Isoleucine.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
#' Plot the chromatogram for an m/z slice containing Leucine and Isoleucine
mzr <- 132.10191 + c(-0.01, 0.01)
chr <- chromatogram(data_cent, aggregationFun = "max", mz = mzr)
plotChromPeakDensity(chr, simulate = FALSE) 
```

Despite being very close, chromatographic peaks of isomers were successfully
grouped into separate features. 

Results from the correspondence analysis can be accessed with the
`featureDefinition` function. This function returns a data frame with the
retention time and m/z ranges of the apex positions from the peaks assigned to
the feature and their respective indices in the `chromPeaks` matrix.

```{r correspondence-featureDefinitions}
#' Definition of the features
featureDefinitions(data_cent)
```

Also, we can calculate simple per-feature summary statistic with the
`featureSummary` function. This function reports for each feature the total
number and the percentage of samples in which a peak was detected and the total
numbers and percentage of these samples in which more than one peak was assigned
to the feature.

```{r correspondence-featureSummary}
#' Per-feature summary.
head(featureSummary(data_cent)) 
```

The final result from the LC-MS data preprocessing is a matrix with feature
abundances, rows being features, columns samples. Such a matrix can be extracted
with the `featureValues` function from the result object. The function takes two
additional parameters `value` and `method`: `value` defines the column in the
`chromPeaks` table that should be reported in the matrix, and `method` the
approach to handle cases in which more than one peak in a sample is assigned to
the feature. Below we set `value = "into"` (the default) to extract the total
integrated peak area and `method = "maxint"` to report the peak area of the peak
with the largest intensity for features with multiple peaks in a sample.

```{r correspondence-featureValue}
#' feature intensity matrix
fmat <- featureValues(data_cent, value = "into", method = "maxint")
head(fmat)
 
```

While we do have abundances reported for most features, we might also have
missing values for some, like for feature *FT002* in the second sample
above. Such `NA`s occur if no chromatographic peak was assigned to a feature,
either because peak detection failed, or because the corresponding ion is absent
in the respective sample. One possibility to deal with such missing values is
data imputation. With the `fillChromPeaks` function, `xcms` provides however an
alternative approach that integrates the signal measured at the m/z - retention
time region of the feature in the original files of samples for which an `NA`
was reported hence *filling-in* missing peak data. The region from which signal
is recovered is defined by the columns `"mzmin"`, `"mzmax"`, `"rtmin"` and
`"rtmax"` in the `featureDefinitions` data frame, which represent the minimal
and maximal positions of the apexes of all chromatographic peaks assigned to the
feature. Because only peak apex positions are considered, this region might not
be representative of the actual chromatographic peaks. The feature region can
however be increased in m/z and/or retention time retention: parameter `fixedRt`
enables for example the expansion of the feature area in retention time
dimension by a constant value. In the example below we fill-in missing peak data
expanding the feature region by the median width of all chromatographic peaks
in the data.

```{r fillChromPeaks}
#' Number of missing values
sum(is.na(fmat))

#' Determine the median retention time width of detected peaks
rt_med <- median(chromPeaks(data_cent)[, "rtmax"] -
                 chromPeaks(data_cent)[, "rtmin"])

fpp <- FillChromPeaksParam(fixedRt = rt_med / 2)
data_cent <- fillChromPeaks(data_cent, param = fpp)

#' How many missing values after
sum(is.na(featureValues(data_cent)))

fmat_fld <- featureValues(data_cent, value = "into", method = "maxint")
head(fmat_fld) 
```

With `fillChromPeaks` we could *rescue* signal for all but 14 features with
missing values. Note that filled-in peak information can also be removed any
time with the `dropFilledChromPeaks` function. Also, setting `filled = FALSE` in
the `featureValues` function would return only data from detected peaks.

The data analysis would now continue with the feature matrix and could comprise
normalization of the abundances, identification of the compounds and
differential abundance analysis.

One final thing worth mentioning is that `XCMSnExp` objects keep, next to the
preprocessing results, also a history of all processing steps and all parameter
objects used during the analysis. The process history can be accessed with the
`processHistory` function.

```{r correspondence-result-object}
#' Overview of the performed processings
processHistory(data_cent)
```

The parameter object for one analysis step can be accessed with `processParam`:

```{r correspondence-history}
#' Access the parameter class for a processing step
processParam(processHistory(data_cent)[[1]])
```

# Bonus material - peak detection fun

In this section we apply the lessons learned from previous sections, in
particular how to adapt peak detection setting on a rather noisy
*chromatographic* data. Below we load the example data from a text file.

```{r peaks-load}
data <- read.table("data/Chromatogram.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
head(data)
```

Our data has two columns, one with *retention times* and one with
*intensities*. We can now create a `Chromatogram` object from that and plot the
data.

```{r peaks-plot, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 2.15}
chr <- Chromatogram(rtime = data$rt, intensity = data$intensity)
par(mar = c(2, 2, 0, 0))
plot(chr)
```

There are two peaks present in the data, with the signal from the latter being
particularly noisy. The goal is now to perform the peak detection and to
identify the two peaks. A first try with the default settings for *centWave*
clearly shows that we have to tune the parameters (note that the setting of `sn
= 0` is required for the present data set as there are not enough *background*
data points for the algorithm to estimate the noise level properly).

Which parameter would you now adapt to the data? What would be your choices? Go
ahead and try different settings or setting combination to see if you can
succeed in detecting the two peaks. Eventually you might even try a different
peak detection algorithm (e.g. `MatchedFilterParam`).

```{r peaks-fail, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 2.35}
xchr <- findChromPeaks(chr, param = CentWaveParam(sn = 0))
par(mar = c(2, 2, 0, 0))
plot(xchr)
```

With the default parameters centWave clearly failed to identify the two large
peaks, defining only smaller fragments of them as potential peaks. Especially
the second peak with its peculiar tri-forked shape seems to cause troubles. This
would be even for a hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography (HILIC), known
to potentially result in noisy odd-shaped peaks, a rather unusual peak shape. In
fact, the signal we were analyzing here is not of chromatographic origin:

```{r peaks-solution, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 2.35, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(png)
library(RColorBrewer)
img <- readPNG("images/Paternkofel_DreiZinnen.png")
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(3, 3, pch = NA, xlim = range(rtime(chr)), ylim = c(0, 235))
rasterImage(img, 200, 0, 1200, 235)

par(new = TRUE)
xchr <- findChromPeaks(
    chr, param = CentWaveParam(sn = 0, peakwidth = c(200, 600)))
plot(xchr, ylim = c(0, 235), peakCol = "grey", lwd = 2,
     peakBg = paste0(brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[c(1, 3)], 30))

```

Our example data represents a panorama picture featuring mountains from the
Dolomites, the [*Paternkofel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternkofel) (left
peak, colored red) and the famous [*Drei
Zinnen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tre_Cime_di_Lavaredo) (right tri-forked
peak colored green).
